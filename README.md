# SQAaaS OpenAPI server

## Overview
[OpenAPI](https://openapis.org) implementation for the SQA-as-a-Service (SQAaaS) platform.

### API First strategy
The SQAaaS API implementation follows an API First strategy, where changes in the specification
are subsequently coded.

#### The OpenAPI specification
The SQAaaS API specification is maintained in a separate [repository](https://github.com/eosc-synergy/sqaaas-api-spec). 

#### OpenAPI Generator
Whenever the specification changes the code is generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project.
The SQAaaS API uses Python's [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of [aiohttp](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/).

## Requirements
Python 3.5.2+

## Usage
To run the server, please execute the following from the root directory:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m openapi_server
```

and open your browser to here:

```
http://localhost:8080/v1/ui/
```

The SQAaaS OpenAPI definition can be accessed through:

```
http://localhost:8080/v1/openapi.json
```

To launch the integration tests, use pytest:
```
sudo pip install -r test-requirements.txt
pytest
```

## Prevent file overriding

The generator does not modify the set of files maintained in the [.openapi-generator-ignore](.openapi-generator-ignore).
